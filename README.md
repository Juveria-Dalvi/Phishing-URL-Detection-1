# WebShield

WebShield is a React application designed to detect phishing URLs based on predefined patterns. It presents the results in a user-friendly table format along with visualizations using pie charts.

## Product Example: WebShield

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Analysis**:  
  When a user enters a URL into the WebShield interface, the system immediately analyzes it against a database of known phishing URLs and applies machine learning algorithms to predict whether it's safe or suspicious. The user receives instant feedback with a clear “Safe,” “Suspicious,” or “Phishing” label.

- **Browser Extension**:  
  Users can install the PhishGuard Pro extension for Chrome and Firefox. When they visit a website, the extension checks the URL in real time and displays a colored indicator in the browser’s address bar (green for safe, yellow for suspicious, red for phishing). If the user attempts to navigate to a known phishing site, a popup appears with a warning and options to report the site.

- **User Reporting System**:  
  If a user encounters a suspicious URL that isn't flagged by the detector, they can easily report it through a simple form in the app or browser extension. This report gets sent to the PhishGuard Pro team, who reviews and adds it to the database if verified.

- **Threat Intelligence Feed**:  
  PhishGuard Pro integrates with external threat intelligence services that continuously update the database with newly identified phishing URLs and tactics. This keeps the detection capabilities current and effective.

- **Domain Reputation Score**:  
  Each analyzed URL displays a domain reputation score, indicating how trustworthy the domain is based on historical data, user reports, and threat intelligence. A score of 80-100 might indicate a safe site, while 0-20 signals high risk.

- **Mobile App**:  
  PhishGuard Pro offers a mobile app that allows users to scan URLs on their phones. Users can copy a URL from their mobile browser and paste it into the app for quick checks, receiving instant results on the URL's safety.

## User Journey Example

**Scenario**: A user receives an email with a suspicious link.

1. The user copies the URL and opens the PhishGuard Pro app.
2. They paste the URL into the app, which runs a real-time analysis.
3. The app quickly returns a result: "Suspicious - Domain Reputation Score: 35."
4. The user decides to report the URL as potentially phishing.
5. They navigate to the PhishGuard Pro extension on their browser to check other links while browsing.
6. They see a green indicator for a safe site and a red indicator for another link in an email, prompting them to avoid clicking it.
